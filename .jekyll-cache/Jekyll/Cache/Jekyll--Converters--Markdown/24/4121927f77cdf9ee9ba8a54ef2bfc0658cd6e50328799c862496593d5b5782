  <p>Any attempt to use such codes as a means of deciphering social space must surely reduce that space itself to the status of a <em>message</em>, and the inhabiting of it to the status of a <em>reading</em>.</p>

<p>A sought-for science of space:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Represents the political use of knowledge…</li>
  <li>Implies an ideology designed to conceal that use…</li>
  <li>Embodies at best a technological utopia, a sort of computer simulation of the future.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>…the aim is to discover or construct a theoretical unity between ‘fields’ which are apprehended seperately, just as molecular, electromagnetic and gravitational forces are in physics. <strong>The fields we are concerned with are, first, the <em>physical</em> - nature, the Cosmosl secondly, the <em>mental</em>, including logical and formal abstractions; and, thirdly, the <em>social</em>.</strong> In other words, we are concerned with the logico-epistemological space, the space of social practice, the space occupied by sensory phenomena including products of the imagination such as projects and projections, symbols and utopias.</p>

  <p>The fact remains that an already produced space can be decoded, can be <em>read</em>.</p>

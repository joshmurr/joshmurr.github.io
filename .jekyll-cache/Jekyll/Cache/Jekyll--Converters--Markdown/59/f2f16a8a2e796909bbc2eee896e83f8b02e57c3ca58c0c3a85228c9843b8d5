<p>In his A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace, John Perry Barlow, when speaking from Cyberspace or what he calls ‘the new home of mind’, says to the ‘Governments of the Industrial World … leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.’[2] Although an admirable and worthy stance to take to defend what was intended to allow ‘everyone, everywhere to share information, access opportunities, and collaborate across geographic and cultural boundaries’[14], you do not need to dig very deep to see that Cyberspace was not left untampered with.</p>

<p>Entire states now control what their citizens can and can’t see online (as with China’s Golden Shield Project); consulting firms are hired by political bodies around the world to form strategies based on analysis of easily accessible digital assets (Cambridge Analytica) and soldiers with journalsim skills are sought ‘to engage in unconventional warfare in the information age’[16]. I doubt Barlow could have predicted the scale at which Cyberspace has become political. Cy- berspace is now woven into the fabric of our lives in more ways than we can appreciate. (I will be using the term Cyberspace in this essay, as Barlow did, as I feel it embodies more of the outside effectors, internal ideologies, and apparent feeling of the space I am talking of).</p>

<p>Benjamin H. Bratton understands the modern world in what he calls The Stack. The Stack is Bratton’s attempt to create an abstract model of the world; to sort through the layering and interconnected systems which make up the physical Westphalian territories we inhabit but also the geopolitical nature of the online landscape and the distortions of both has they mingle and intersect [3].</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Stack model suggests both the means and ends of a specific kind of platform sovereignty. It demands that we understand the designability of geography in relation to the designability of com- putation and to see the state (and other soveriegn institutions) in relation to both at once.[4]</p>

<p>The physical world as we know it has been subject to all manner of ecological and social experiments driven by utopian the vision of leaders or experts from various ideologies. From the ‘scientific forestry’ developed from 1765 to 1800 which aimed to re-plant forests for tree-felling to more ‘closely resemble the administrative grid of it’s techniques’[10], to the Le Corbusier inspired pinnacle of high-modernity in the design and build of Brasilia. The top-down designed city of Brasilia was supposed to be a ‘city of the future … a realizable utopia’ but in reality it was a misunderstanding of what the local people needed and wanted.[11] These examples given by James C. Scott as times when the state imposes its analytical model-based view of the world back on to the world itself are reasonably simple to understand, and thus the errors in oversimplification are somewhat clear (the undermining of the nuance relations between the trees of the forest and the undergrowth, or the inhabitants of a city and how they congregate and socialise). But the relationship between state and citizen is less clear in Cyberspace where in fact the state is not the only body with power, as perhaps Barlow suggested; the citizen may be rather more atomised in their digital existence; and the ways in which the system ‘produces new territories in its image’[3] is a lot less obvious.</p>

<p>The User in Bratton’s model is described as the Apollo astronaut ‘a com- posite effect of interlocking organic and inorganic skins and metabolisms’ which interacts with the various layers of The Stack (Earth, Cloud, City, Address, Interface) as a ‘limited effector of processes bubbling up and down.’[5] Perhaps Bratton’s User is a more appropriate means to understand how one (a human being) interacts with The Stack, more akin to a Cyborg as described by Donna Haraway.
Biology and evolutionary theory over the past two centuries have simultaneously produced modern organisms as objects of knowledge and reduced the line between humans and animals to a faint trace re-etched in ideological struggle or professional disputes between life and social science.[8]</p>

<p>title:</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt currently feel I have much of a working practice to comment on it‚Äôs category of art or design, but to consider previous work (which I now see as dated), and my current areas of interest, I suppose it would be considered art. I think deliberately categorising work in either field can limit it‚Äôs potential. I have an innate fear that if <em>art</em> is the desired outcome, then the process is instantly biased and no longer faithful to true inquiry.</p>

<p>I tend to think of the world as a fractal of complex systems, which in themselves are not beyond understanding. So to take things on a small scale such as building a wardrobe, painting a portrait, writing a simple piece of software; I enjoy the process of breaking apart the desired outcome into it‚Äôs constituent parts and working on these individually. I am particularly interested in working with code, and have been for some time, because I feel it is quite a pure representation of this idea, but it is also the language of our time. I want to understand the things I don‚Äôt know, and a lot of that comes from understanding the language of computers (along with mathematics and physics).</p>

<p>My work (if my work can exist just as ideas, for now) is generally based on educated assumptions which will hopefully allow me to learn through doing. I am making assumtions based on how I think the world works: the areas which <em>should</em> be of interest, and <em>could</em> yeild interesting results. Aesthetics of course play a role, and I have my personal tastes, but the visual output is often a side-affect and I tend not to lead with aesthetics.</p>

<p>My methods are considered, and I tend not to do anything unless I feel it slots into my self-made bigger picture. That picture feels more like a puzzle which I‚Äôve lost the box to, but the moments where I find fragments which slot together nicely are satisfying enough to keep working on it. <em>If</em> I am successful in learning about what I deem to be important then hopefully my output will in someway reflect that. I do want to make a conscious effort to make this output understood and digestible to those who happen to come across it. I think there is a responsibility involved, particularly if my work is to be considered art, or artistic, for it to aim towards clarity rather than furthuring confusion or mysticism.</p>

<p>I would like to think that what I am making is relevant to contemporary culture. I‚Äôm not really interested in the past, unless it is to understand the present. I am also not particularly interested in craft or tradition when it comes to making. I want to understand contemporary tools to be able to use them. And I want to use them to interrogate other aspects of the world which can only by understood with modern tooling. I don‚Äôt want to use hi-tech tools to make modern day paintings - I want to be working with entirely ‚Äúnew‚Äù media: simulation, systems, collaboration.</p>

<p>Right now my work is making little-to-no difference to it‚Äôs field, but it is not my intention to remain in a vacuum. I look forward to mixing in a new world of talented people, and contributing as much as I can.</p>

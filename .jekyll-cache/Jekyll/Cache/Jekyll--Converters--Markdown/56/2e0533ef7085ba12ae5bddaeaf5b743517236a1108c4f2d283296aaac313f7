I"Ì<p>Some more progress with the ofxBoids library, finally! Iâ€™ve been ticking away at it slowly. But Iâ€™ve also been trying to get my head around calculus, and also have a 3D printer now which is taking up some spare timeâ€”all good things though.</p>

<p>There is always some amount of head scratching when it comes to implementing a new vector-maths-based feature, and this time it was the <em>Flowfield</em>. In practice it was nothing new really, just still getting used to some C++-isms with one-dimensional vectors (arrays) and how to iterate through them as a two-dimensional array. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1817631/iterating-one-dimension-array-as-two-dimension-array">This Stackoverflow post</a> was useful for that.</p>

<p>Once I got that sorted, the rest was pretty simple! And now I can have many boids/vehicles flying around following the flowfield. Next step is to get on to path-following and eventually flocking behaviours which is was this is all about really!</p>

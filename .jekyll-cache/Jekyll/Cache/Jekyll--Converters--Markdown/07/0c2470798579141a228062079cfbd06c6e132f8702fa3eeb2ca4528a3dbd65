I"’<p>As a quick summary, at page 15, what I can gather from what Morton is saying is that a <em>Hyperobject</em> is anything which is beyond a humanly scale. This can include things like the weather, a mountain, the internet, conciousness, etc. At this scale ‚Äúobjects‚Äù take of aspects of phenomena. Phenomena are things which are somewhat contentious in rational, scientific thought. So a <em>Hyperobject</em> is somewhere between science and fiction. Morton brings up the chasm between <em>phenomena</em> and <em>thing</em> a number of times, and this divide/connection as a complication in philosophical and scientific thought.</p>

<p>I think Morton, by looking at Hyperobjects and Object Oriented Ontology (OOO), he is bringing the human, and in particular all the things which have been seen as specifically and <em>specially</em> human (like thought, conciousness, emotion etc.) all back down onto the same level as objects; stuff; things; which make up the real world around us.</p>

<p>I think this is exactly why the term <em>Hyperobject</em> is used. These super-human notions of complexity beyond the realm of human scale, are in fact objects, like everything else we exist alongside. It is the taming of the phenomena.</p>

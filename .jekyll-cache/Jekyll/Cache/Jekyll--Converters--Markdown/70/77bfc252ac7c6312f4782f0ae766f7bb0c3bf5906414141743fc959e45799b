I"“%<p>Ray Kurzweil quite rightly said â€˜ours is the species that inherently seeks to extend its physical and mental reach beyond current limitationsâ€™\cite{kurzweil_2006}. Throughout all history humankind has sought to improve its quality of life and ability to sustain its existence through experimentation, analysis and technology. Yuval Noah Harari outlines human development as a series of revolutionsâ€”cognitive, agricultural, scientificâ€”each of which acted as catalysts, rocketing cognitive development of humans towards the next revolution\cite{harari_2011}.</p>

<p>As civilisations emerge over time, and societies become more complex with economies, governments, religion and other strange human creations; progress itself became an intentional feature of civilisation and a focus on science and technological development emerges. The industrial revolution gave humankind new technologies with which to spread knowledge, travel and conquer\cite{lent_2017}, feeding back into the system of development. Alvin Toffler, writing in 1965, contemplates the immediate future ahead of him, and is worriedly aware of the rate of progress. Worried enough to use the term <code class="highlighter-rouge">Future Shock'' to describe the</code>super-imposition of a new culture on an old oneâ€™â€™ brought on by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">greatly accelerated rate of change in society''[^1]. Pointing to very modern technologies of the time such as air flight, television, nuclear energy, the computer and the codification of DNA, Toffler proclaims that</code>what is happening now (in 1965) is anything like â€˜normalâ€™ progressâ€™â€™.</p>

<p>Kurzweil similarly is aware, but slightly more excited by, the increasing rate of development human kind is experiencing. He points out that it is only now (in 2005) as we find ourselves at the knee of the exponential curve of growth that we can get a sense of the rapidity of progress. ``We wonâ€™t experience one hundred years of technological advance in the twenty-first century; we will witness on the order of twenty thousand years of progress.â€™â€˜\cite{kurzweil_2006}</p>

<p>The increase in computing power, and the ubiquity of computing at large has been the latest and most powerful stimulant for progress, kicking us into the ``knee of the curveâ€™â€™. These tools are far more powerful today and show great potential in all areas of science. The availability of Graphics Processing Units (GPU) along with seemingly unlimited digital storage and a flood of data collected from every possible source has allowed artificial intelligence research to explode in recent times, entirely reversing the doubts of AIs capabilities leading to the so-called \textit{AI Winter}\cite{aiml} of the 1980s. The commercial applications of AI in things like market analysis, predictive services and efficiency gains in logistics contributed to the financial boom in AI. DeepMind, a London based AI firm, was acquired by Google in 2014 for Â£400-million\cite{guardian_2014} and in 2016 AlphaGo (an AI system designed by DeepMind to play the ancient Chinese game of Go, a game which has $10^{170}$ possible board configurations) beat the worlds leading player Lee Sedolâ€”a landmark event in AI development.</p>

<p>Kurzweil sits among many other powerful players in the modern technology scene (Musk, Tegmark, Harris, Bostrom etc.) most of which are aware of this alarming rate of development\cite{future_of_life_2017_video}. So much so that Max Tegmark founded the \textit{Future of Life Institute} which exhibits the tagline ``Technology is giving life the potential to flourish like never before\ldots or to self-destruct. Letâ€™s make a difference!â€™â€˜\cite{future_of_life_2016} We are very much living in the time period that Toffler was speculating of and it has been named the Anthropocene: the epoch of time \textit{Homo Sapiens} became the single most important agent of change in the global ecology\cite{harari_2015}. Arguably this has been the case for centuries, but the current climate crisis is hard-to-ignore evidence of this human impact drifting out of control. So perhaps these experts are worried for the right reasons?</p>

<p>Writing in 1965, the same time as Alvin Toffler, Donald Judd is noticing strange patterns emerging in the art world. Artists, largely considered painters, are producing what could be considered paintings, but seem to embody three-dimensional qualities. The work of Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, Ad Reinhardt and Kenneth Noland seems to exist on a two-dimensional plane but can be <code class="highlighter-rouge">both flat and infinitely spatial'' or</code>give the appearance of sections cut from something infinitely largerâ€™â€˜\cite{judd_kellein_2002}.</p>

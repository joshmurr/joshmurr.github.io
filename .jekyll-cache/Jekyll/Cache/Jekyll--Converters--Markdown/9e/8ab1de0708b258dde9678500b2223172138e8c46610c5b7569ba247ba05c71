I"7<p>I was holding off writing a post until I had some content to put in it. But currently I have my fingers in a number of warm pies, each of which I will write about soon and by at least stating my intentions now, perhaps I will get that ball rolling. I also just want to get the ‘Hello World’ post out of the way.</p>

<p><strong>Pies</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>As of today, I have two live applications, both for Computer Science MSc’s, one at Imperial and the other at UCL. Both courses seem great and I will hold off stating my preference in case someone reviewing my application has wandered this far.</li>
  <li>I am going back to basics in mathematics on ‘Kahn Academy’ which is a service (?) I’ve always admired but never genuinely used and I must say it is fantastic.

  <li>I am playing with OpenFrameworks. Almost at the end of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mastering-openFrameworks-Creative-Coding-Demystified/dp/1849518041">‘Mastering OpenFrameworks’</a> which is a great book.

  <li>I have fully commited to Vim and find all other editors annoying now. Which is nice.
<img src="../../../assets/images/vim_sample.png" alt="vim" /></li>
  <li><a href="http://joshmurr.com">I have a bad website.</a></li>
  <li>I guess I’m on the road to a life based in, on and around computing. Whether my applications above are successful or not (they may not be), that <em>is</em> the road I’m on.</li>
</ol>

<p>In his A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace, John Perry Barlow, when speaking from Cyberspace or what he calls â€˜the new home of mindâ€™, says to the â€˜Governments of the Industrial World â€¦ leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.â€™[2] Although an admirable and worthy stance to take to defend what was intended to allow â€˜everyone, everywhere to share information, access opportunities, and collaborate across geographic and cultural boundariesâ€™[14], you do not need to dig very deep to see that Cyberspace was not left untampered with.</p>

<p>Entire states now control what their citizens can and canâ€™t see online (as with Chinaâ€™s Golden Shield Project); consulting firms are hired by political bodies around the world to form strategies based on analysis of easily accessible digital assets (Cambridge Analytica) and soldiers with journalsim skills are sought â€˜to engage in unconventional warfare in the information ageâ€™[16]. I doubt Barlow could have predicted the scale at which Cyberspace has become political. Cy- berspace is now woven into the fabric of our lives in more ways than we can appreciate. (I will be using the term Cyberspace in this essay, as Barlow did, as I feel it embodies more of the outside effectors, internal ideologies, and apparent feeling of the space I am talking of).</p>

<p>Benjamin H. Bratton understands the modern world in what he calls The Stack. The Stack is Brattonâ€™s attempt to create an abstract model of the world; to sort through the layering and interconnected systems which make up the physical Westphalian territories we inhabit but also the geopolitical nature of the online landscape and the distortions of both has they mingle and intersect [3].</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Stack model suggests both the means and ends of a specific kind of platform sovereignty. It demands that we understand the designability of geography in relation to the designability of com- putation and to see the state (and other soveriegn institutions) in relation to both at once.[4]</p>

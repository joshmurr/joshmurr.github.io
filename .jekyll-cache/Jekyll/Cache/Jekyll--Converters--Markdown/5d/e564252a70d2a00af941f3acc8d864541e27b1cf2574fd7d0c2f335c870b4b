I"Ü<p>Evidently I‚Äôve let a few months go by without any update on here, but I‚Äôve kept busy regardless.</p>

<p>I kept up with the maths on Kahn Academy. I finished the Precalculus course and moved on to the Differential Calculus. Still maths which I did at A-Level but a little harder to get into. Good to be doing some calculus with machine learning in mind, but I‚Äôve shelved the maths for a little while to focus on learning C++.</p>

<h3 id="c">C++</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm currently about 70% through this Udemy C++ course. It‚Äôs my first time enrolling on a Udemy course and this one isn‚Äôt bad. It‚Äôs a little slow and could potentially be more thorough, but it is good practice to see C++ used from scratch. The outcome will be a particle simulator too which I always enjoy. Once I‚Äôve worked through this I hopefully will have enough understanding to write simeple graphical applications in C++ with basic graphics libraries, like SDL. I have in mind to create some some cellula automata programs. And also to return to the ofxBoids library with newfound C++ knowledge.</p>

<h3 id="speakers-and-amplifier">Speakers and Amplifier</h3>

<p>Something I‚Äôve wanted to do for years is to make my own speakers and an amplifier set up. So I‚Äôve finally begun that process with a pretty simple set up. The speaker drivers are 5‚Äù 8ohm full range 20W nominal Visaton‚Äôs. And the amp consists of a small <a href="https://quasarelectronics.co.uk/Item/velleman-k8084-volume-tone-control-pre-amplifier-kit">Velleman pre-amp kit build</a> and a 30W <a href="https://quasarelectronics.co.uk/Item/velleman-k4003-2-x-30w-stereo-audio-power-amplifier-kit">Velleman power amp kit</a>. I‚Äôm yet to test anything‚Ä¶</p>

<p>I read in an article somewhere that this was a good online course to take, and it does seem like a good one after the first lecture and a half. It gets into C programming early and then works up through the abstractions, up to working with Python and JavaScript. I‚Äôve been wanting to do some pure C programming and this seems like a nice primer to get into.</p>

<p>I think that‚Äôs all that is necessary for an update. I have also been working at an architecture school as a workshop technician and I‚Äôve been reading some books. But maybe more about those things another time.</p>

<p>Playing with <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Kahn Academy</a> has really brought home the power of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification">â€˜gamificationâ€™</a>. Itâ€™s amazing how much more addictive it is learning with constant feedback and reminders of progress.</p>

<p>Gamification is quite a common thing these days. Many apps and websites include some amount of rewards for regular use, or feedback on progress often adorned with badges and sound effects. Kahn Academy has a particularly smart way of incrementing through the exercises while making sure you are progressing at a pace which is working for you, whilst also mixing it up enough to keep it interesting. Itâ€™s made more interesting for me in that I am returning to mathematic exercises which I have been through before (about 10 years ago whilst doing my A-Levels). So I have the added reward of it coming back to be as I work, but I think there is a combination of quick feedback, detailed progress reports, short videos and the right amount of variation which is keeping me engaged.</p>

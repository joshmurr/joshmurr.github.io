I finished a BA in Illustration and Visual Media in 2014 at the London College of Communication with a First-class Honours. It was a very broad and flexible course and in my first year, in a self-initiated project about logic, I discovered programming in Processing and was hooked. The degree allowed me to continue to produce work using Processing in various visual and interactive ways, and I later moved on to the web working mostly in Javascript. In 3rd year I wrote my dissertation on the Open Source movement and what this means for designers, wondering if designers were to adopt the principles of Open Source and also learn the tools, would the role of the designer change to that of an outcome driven, stylistic designer, to one which instead designs frameworks and systems to allow for more a generative and iterative practice.

Interested in all things Open Source I continued to explore what I could learn for free and furthured my knowledge of the web with PHP and MySQL databases and also re-writing many Processing apps in Javascript. Later I moved on to Python and more recently C++ through OpenFrameworks. I've also dabbled with more esoteric languages such as Donald Knuth's 'MetaFont'. In the past year I have made the commitment to only using Vim as a text editor in an effort to make all aspects of work efficient. 

My programming work at university culminated in a piece of software written in Processing which generates random stickers based on a large set of words. It would choose a word at random, perfom a web search to select an image, apply some image fitering with a Floyd-Steinberg Dither which I wrote myself, and then store these images online to publish them directly to a blog, and also locally to automatically print them in batches of 12. This process could be run randomly as described, or the user could choose the word, infuence the colors and repeat the process to find a sticker they like. It was a fun project playing with randomness and user-interaction. I also experimented with a generative typeface, an Open Source typeface created with MetaFont, and 'Ideas-Bank' which is a website for sharing ideas — among many other small projects.

I was drawn to Computing Science at Imperial firstly as it is suitable for those from other disciplines, but also as it is largely taught in C++ which I feel is the language I'll be working in mostly from now on. The core modules also fascinate me – I'm excited to learn as much as I can about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, but also Graphics to expand my skillset to make computational work visual. It also appeals because it seems difficult! I'm a champion of self teaching, but I am ready to make the commitment to going deeper and really learning computer science, to truly understand the potential of using a computer as a tool.

I very much enjoy self-study and a big reason why I love programming is that a big part of it (if not most) relies of self-study, and there is a wealth of accessible information out there which allows one to do so. But ultimately I want a rich understanding of how computers work, and how we as programmers can get computers to do what we want them to! I know this requires knowledge of computer architecture, algorithms, operating systems and so on, and it is these areas of study which I feel I will benefit from structured teaching from knowledgable people. I have began exploring these avenues with Nisan and Schocken's 'The Elements of Computing Systems', and have also returned to return to Mathematics which I very much enjoy (achieving an A at A-Level, and a B in physics), using tools such as Kahn Academy and EdX online and I'm excited to take this further to better understand algorithm design and theory.

Ultimately I still want to be working with visual or interactive systems, whether that is in the arts (such as work created by Memo Akten, Karsten Schmidt or Kyle Mcdonald), or creating accessible systems for those that need it whether through apps or physical computing such as those at Open Bionics, or designing generative systems for manufacture such as Michael Hansmeyer and his work with Computational Architecture.

I have worked as a carpenter and fabricator for the past four years which is an industry I partly fell into. I have always enjoyed making things, and various circumstances led to me getting work as a carpenter. I have built this up over time to managing a small workshop and business culminating and some large projects such as an entirely bespoke office fit out for the Shadow Robot Company which involved a lot of laser cut steel and CNC'd sheet material. I have employed and managed small groups of people and liased directly with the client to help achieve this and other jobs. I am also the Build Manager for a music and arts festival called Brainchiled where I manage a team of up to 30 volunteers to build and maintain the festival of 3000 people over ten days. Team-work and management are vital skills in any industry and I am proud of my ability to get on and work with any demographic of people.

I hold Imperial College in very high regard and would be honoured to be studying there. I love that Imperial has close ties with The Royal College of Art which is another instituion I respect and at a time had aspirations of once studying there — this says to me that Imperial is interested in inter-disciplinary work which I feel is key to the development of all industry. I expect to be challenged but this is exactly what I want. I want to be surrounded by motivated, hard working and intelligent peers and tutors to inspire me to work harder to get to where I want to be.

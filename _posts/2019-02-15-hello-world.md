I was holding off writing a post until I had some content to put in it. But currently I have my fingers in a number of warm pies, each of which I will write about soon and by at least stating my intentions now, perhaps I will get that ball rolling. I also just want to get the 'Hello World' post out of the way.

__Pies__
1. As of today, I have two live applications, both for Computer Science MSc's, one at Imperial and the other at UCL. Both courses seem great and I will hold off stating my preference in case someone reviewing my application has wandered this far.
2. I am going back to basics in mathematics on 'Kahn Academy' which is a service (?) I've always admired but never genuinely used and I must say it is fantastic.

3. I am playing with OpenFrameworks. Almost at the end of ['Mastering OpenFrameworks'](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mastering-openFrameworks-Creative-Coding-Demystified/dp/1849518041) which is a great book.

4. I have fully commited to Vim and find all other editors annoying now. Which is nice.

5. [I have a bad website.](joshmurr.com)
6. I guess I'm on the road to a life based in, on and around computing. Whether my applications above are successful or not (they may not be), that _is_ the road I'm on.

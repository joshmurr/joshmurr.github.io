As a quick summary, at page 15, what I can gather from what Morton is saying is that a _Hyperobject_ is anything which is beyond a humanly scale. This can include things like the weather, a mountain, the internet, conciousness, etc. At this scale "objects" take of aspects of phenomena. Phenomena are things which are somewhat contentious in rational, scientific thought. So a _Hyperobject_ is somewhere between science and fiction. Morton brings up the chasm between _phenomena_ and _thing_ a number of times, and this divide/connection as a complication in philosophical and scientific thought.

I think Morton, by looking at Hyperobjects and Object Oriented Ontology (OOO), he is bringing the human, and in particular all the things which have been seen as specifically and _specially_ human (like thought, conciousness, emotion etc.) all back down onto the same level as objects; stuff; things; which make up the real world around us.

I think this is exactly why the term _Hyperobject_ is used. These super-human notions of complexity beyond the realm of human scale, are in fact objects, like everything else we exist alongside. It is the taming of the phenomena.

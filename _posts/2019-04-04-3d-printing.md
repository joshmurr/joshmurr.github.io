_Some 3D printing experiments with my new [Creality Ender 3](https://www.google.com/search?q=creality+ender+3&rlz=1C5CHFA_enGB728GB728&oq=creality+en&aqs=chrome.0.0j69i60j69i57j69i60j69i59l2.3319j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) (which I love)._

First is a screen case I made for [this](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/New-7-LCD-Display-Monitor-Screen-Driver-Board-HDMI-VGA-2AV-for-Raspberry-Pi/273498477156?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649) Raspberry Pi screen.

And a pulley which I've made to do weighted deadhangs on a fingerboard which I've also made.
